ASGI base libraries, including:

* Sync-to-async and async-to-sync function wrappers, ``asgiref.sync``
* Server base classes, ``asgiref.server``
* WSGI-to-ASGI adapter, in ``asgiref.wsgi``


Function wrappers
-----------------

These allow you to wrap or decorate async or sync functions to call them from
the other style (so you can call async functions from a synchronous thread,
or vice-versa).

In particular:

* AsyncToSync lets a synchronous subthread stop and wait while the async
  function is called on the main thread's event loop, and then control is
  returned to the thread when the async function is finished.

* SyncToAsync lets async code call a synchronous function, which is run in
  a threadpool and control returned to the async coroutine when the synchronous
  function completes.

The idea is to make it easier to call synchronous APIs from async code and
asynchronous APIs from synchronous code so it's easier to transition code from
one style to the other. In the case of Channels, we wrap the (synchronous)
Django view system with SyncToAsync to allow it to run inside the (asynchronous)
ASGI server.


Server base classes
-------------------

Includes a ``StatelessServer`` class which provides all the hard work of
writing a stateless server (as in, does not handle direct incoming sockets
but instead consumes external streams or sockets to work out what is happening).

An example of such a server would be a chatbot server that connects out to
a central chat server and provides a "connection scope" per user chatting to
it. There's only one actual connection, but the server has to separate things
into several scopes for easier writing of the code.

You can see an example of this being used in `frequensgi <https://github.com/andrewgodwin/frequensgi>`_.


WSGI-to-ASGI adapter
--------------------

Allows you to wrap a WSGI application so it appears as a valid ASGI application.

Simply wrap it around your WSGI application like so::

    asgi_application = WsgiToAsgi(wsgi_application)

The WSGI application will be run in a synchronous threadpool, and the wrapped
ASGI application will be one that accepts ``http`` class messages.

Please note that not all extended features of WSGI may be supported (such as
file handles for incoming POST bodies).


Dependencies
------------

``asgiref`` requires Python 3.5 or higher.
